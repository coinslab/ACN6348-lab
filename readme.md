Step 5. Locate and choose the unzipped folder `ACN6348-lab`
Step 6. Start Julia REPL using `Ctlr` + `Shift` + `P` --> `Start REPL` (`Cmd` + `Shift` + `P` for Mac)
Step 7. Run `setup.jl` script by clicking on the play button

**Note**: You only need to `setup.jl` the first time you are setting up this project folder. From second time onwards, you can directly start the notebook (`*.ipynb`) files.

Step 8. Open your notebook from the explorer window in VS Code.

Step 9. Run the notebook

Step 10. If prompted, choose `Julia 1.8` for kernel.

If you want to re-run a code block, you can do `Shift` + `Enter` on that code-block. 

When running the notebook for the first time and it shows "precompiling", it can take a while. It's completely normal and predomination time depends on the configuration of your computer.
